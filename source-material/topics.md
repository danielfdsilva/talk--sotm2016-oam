Questions:
> - Can/should we do a demo of the uploader? How would we go about that?

I'm trying to work on getting some imagery from Drone Adventures this week. Hopefully by the end of this week we have some new imagery that we can use to upload. 

> - growth of the community and tools?

Mention two projects: PacDID -- applying OAM in the Pacific Islands; and POSM -- using OAM tools for a packaged system that can be used offline.

PacDid - applying OAM in the Pacific Islands. (Nate Smith)

Posm - Portable osm. Being able to run a full osm in a raspberry pie. Offline mode. Oam would help out by preparing imagery. be part of the toolchain. (American Red Cross, leading out the project)

> - plans for how imagery within OAM can be integrated with OSM?

That's basically in place at the moment. You can open up any imagery into an OSM editor like JOSM or iD. Could mention how in the future more on-demand tile proccessing could be available for generating new imagery to be used. 

> - The OAM community is planning for more growth. What kind?

One focus is bringing on new partners contributing to the Open Imagery Network. Increasing the number of partner organizations contributing to their own buckets of imagery.
